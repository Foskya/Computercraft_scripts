In both programs the turtle dig a 1x1 tunnel (so no mobs can spawn later) and checks, for every block mined,
if there is a resource in all the 6 block facing the turtle; if it finds one, then it will mine it and look it there is a vein of said resource.
Once the turtle has reached the prefixed distance, it will mine 8 block laterally and then come back (while still looking for resources)

"strip_mine.lua" mines horizontally; if you are looking for a certain ore (at a certain height) it is generally better to use this, however be wary of unloaded chunks.
If the turtle ends up in a chunk that is not loaded, it will stops in its track (even if the chunk get loaded after).
If you are playing with the mod "Peripherals Advanced" you can simply put a chunk loader on the turtle and let it run for how long (and how far) you wish.

On the other hand "strip_mine_vertical.lua", as the name suggests, mines vertically. 
This is useful if you are looking for a varied amount of resources or you do not want to risk loosing your turtle in an unloaded area
